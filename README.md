Scripts and utilities for setting up a macOS computer the way I use it.

## Disclaimer

This is and _always_ will be a WIP repo, because I'm constantly adding new stuff and improving my workflow. Moreover, this script sets up everything the way _I_ use and like it.

Therefore, I'm not responsible for thermonuclear wars, explosions, etc. etc. caused by this ðŸ˜¬

## Usage

```
$ ./setup.sh
```

## What it does
